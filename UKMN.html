        <h3> Background</h3>
        <p>UK Mask Network is an organisation that advocates for the safety and scientific education of the UK, aiming to raise awareness of the importance and effectiveness of mask-wearing in public spaces. During the lockdown, I picked up this project because it was something I also believed in. This was during a time where there were still a lot of scepticism on wearing a mask as it was still the early stages of the Coronavirus pandemic. Through this role, I have learned more about web design best practices as well as gained more knowledge about mask usage.</p>

        <p class="img-caption" align="center">Homepage</p>
            <h3>What was my role?</h3>
            <p>As a website designer, I worked with another designer and illustrator to create an easy to navigate website for UK Mask Network. </p>
            <h3 align="center"> <strong><em>The Process</em></strong> </h3>
            <h3>Project outline</h3>
            <p>After doing some research navigationg through other blogs/information-based websites and their styles, I tried to take notes of best practices and apply them to UK Mask Networkâ€™s  website with their own theme and colours. As well as having their main information on display on the main homepage, I had to emphasize their social media presence too.</p>
            <h3>Why I decided to use this platform</h3>
            <p>Using WIX was ideal for this organisation, as it allows for my client to be able to take it over once I've completed my project. I made these design and functionality choices for an effective user experience. Also due to needing to make the website as quick as possible, WiX is one platform that allows us to create an effective site within a short time frame due to their effective drag and drop interface. </p>
            <h3>The goal</h3>
            <p>A fully functioning website that allows people to read more about the organisation, tips on how to wear a mask, mask science, latest government news and to be able to contact them with ease. A website that is easy to navigate for all ages and walks of life.</p>
            <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Website (UI) design, website analytics, visual design, prototyping and testing.</p>
            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p>WiX, Adobe Photoshop</p>
            <h3>Knowledge and expertise needed</h3>
            <p>UX and UI design best practice, SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), good writing proficiency.</p>
