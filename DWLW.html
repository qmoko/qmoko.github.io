        <h3> Background</h3>
    <p>DWLW cycle sports is a small online bike store. For years, the store sold bikes through word of mouth and Facebook. In 2020, DWLW have decided it is time to have their own website. To have a place where people can find out more about their company and purchase bikes with ease. Through this role, I was able to further develop and hone my web design skills.</p>

        <p class="img-caption" align="center">Homepage</p>
        
    <h3>The problem</h3>    
    <p>This online bike store did not have consistency on their website, mismatched colours and messy pages, they were in need of a web designer to do a site re-fresh to fix it.</p>
    <h3>What was my role?</h3>
    <p>As a website designer, I worked with the CEO to create an easy to navigate website for DWLW Limited. Advising him on best practices and managing stock through the database.</p>
    <h3 align="center"> <strong><em>The Process</em></strong> </h3>
    <h3>Project outline</h3>
<p>After doing some research observing other popular bike stores (namely Evans Cycles and The Bike Shop), I tried to take notes of best practices, put our own spin on it and apply them to DWLW’s website. I was told they needed an ‘about us’ page and there must be a contact form. More importantly, the bikes needed to be up and with the correct stock labels. The main purpose of the site is to sell bikes, so we had to make sure the bikes were the most important thing on the site. </p>
<h3>Why I decided to use this platform</h3>
<p> Using WIX was ideal for this organisation, as it allowed my client to take it over with ease once I've completed the design. The CMS is very user friendly and making changes to the design can be done in short time.</p>
<h3>The goal</h3>
<p>The site at the early stage was simply a static information page. The main goal was to transform this into a fully functioning e-Commerce website that allows people to read more about the bike shop, make purchases and be able to contact them with ease. A website that is easy to navigate for all ages and walks of life.
    I needed to implement the payment system and ensure that DWLW can gain more customers with a design that is not intimidating for new customers.
</p>
<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Website (UI) design, website analytics, visual design, wireframing and testing.</p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>WiX, Adobe Photoshop, Canva.</p>
<h3>Knowledge and expertise needed</h3>
<p>UX and UI design best practices, SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), good writing proficiency and good research skills.</p>
