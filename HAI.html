	<h3> Background</h3>
<p>Human Aid Initiative is a charity organisation, focussing on providing relief and aid to people in need. From 2019 to 2021, I have been the sole manager of the Human Aid Initiative business website. Here, I have been in charge of website development, design and maintenance. Through this role I have been given a lot of responsibility and the role has taught me a lot on website design and development practices and the processes of how to create a fully functional non-profit website, allowing customers and donors to make purchases and donations from one location.</p>

	<h3>What was my role?</h3>
	<p>As a website developer and designer, my role was to maintain front-end and back-end developments and design a fully functioning website to allow for donors to make payments through the website.</p>
	<p>Along with this, I have also had the pleasure of creating graphics and marketing flyers, this can be seen on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/humanaidinitiative/">Instagram page.</a></p>
	<h3 align="center"> <strong><em>The Process</em></strong> </h3>
	<h3>Project outline</h3>
	<p>After doing some research looking at other non-profit websites and their styles, I tried to take notes of best practices and apply them to HAIâ€™s website. As well as having their main programmes on display on the main homepage, I also needed to implement a safe and robust donation system. This was done through GiveWP plugin. Going into the PHP, I added some additional features to make our donation forms secure (i.e. reCAPTCHA to prevent bots from spamming our system with fraudulent activity). In doing so, I managed to prevent the site from receiving carding attempts and spam within our contact forms.</p>
	<h3>Why I decided to use this platform</h3>
	<p>Using a CMS (Content Management System) like WordPress was ideal for the organisation, as it allows for simple configuration when needing to access the back-end and front-end of the website. 
		The excellent UI of WordPress also allows my client to be able to take it over once I've completed my project. 
		I made these design and functionality choices for a seamless navigation experience. </p>
	<h3>The goal</h3>
	<p>A fully functioning website that allows people to read more about the organisation, what they do, their events, latest disaster news and to be able to make payments in a secure way. A website that is easy to navigate for all ages and walks of life.</p>
	<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
	<p>Website design, website development, website security, plug-ins and themes management, maintenance of payment system, visual design, prototyping and testing.</p>
	<h3>Tools</h3>
	<p>WordPress, GiveWP Plugin, Adobe Photoshop</p>
	<h3>Knowledge and expertise needed</h3>
	<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP</p>
